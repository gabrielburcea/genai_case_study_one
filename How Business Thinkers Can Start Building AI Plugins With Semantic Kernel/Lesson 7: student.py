# MAGIC ou're still here, which means you're kind of hopeful there's a little 
# MAGIC more. Well, this kitchen is a big kitchen. It's a professional-grade kitchen. 
# MAGIC Now, that you've started, you can go off and bring in all kinds of 
# MAGIC components that make your AI kitchen better than 
# MAGIC anyone else's, And you know the secret. So, let's 
# MAGIC take you through the secret hallways of the kitchen to get 
# MAGIC you ready to make even bigger, brighter, bolder 
# MAGIC meals. So, you walk through the planner door with me 
# MAGIC and now you understand the t-shirt I wore 
# MAGIC in the intro and in some of the front bumpers you 
# MAGIC can see, plugins and planners and personas are the key thematic 
# MAGIC areas of Semantic Kernel. 
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC You jumped into plugins deeply, and now you're into the planner world 
# MAGIC and around the corner personas is there, but 
# MAGIC you don't have to wait because come into the 
# MAGIC next notebook and you'll get a nice surprise. And because you 
# MAGIC are hanging out for this last notebook, I want to 
# MAGIC tell you about our open-source chat group pilot. An open-source chat group pilot is 
# MAGIC basically all the kind of chat behaviors you 
# MAGIC might want to be able to build into your app yourself are 
# MAGIC available for absolutely free. It's kind of like having 
# MAGIC a high-end AV available underneath your seat, like an Oprah episode. Look under your 
# MAGIC seat. This is a free application that we made available to 
# MAGIC you that demonstrates a backend and frontend that has 
# MAGIC cool things like a token meter that shows you 
# MAGIC how chat expands different tokens. 
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC It has AI UX behaviors around latency. You've stayed here, so 
# MAGIC I want to give you a present. And the present is letting you 
# MAGIC know about this repo here. This repo, it is https://github.com. Microsoft Chat Compiler. 
# MAGIC But this repo is available for you 
# MAGIC to easily create that application I just saw 
# MAGIC you run it on your own computer. And it's pretty easy to 
# MAGIC install. There's a server backend web API, and there's a front-end web 
# MAGIC app, web apps and TypeScript react. The web API is in C sharp.net. 
# MAGIC No worries. I was not a C sharp.net programmer a few months ago, but it's as 
# MAGIC simple as a".netbuild.dotnetrun". Kind of like a yarn start, yarn install. It's all kind 
# MAGIC of the same nowadays. 
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC So, don't worry, right? And what you can do is you can have 
# MAGIC that cool chat app running on your computer. And 
# MAGIC what happens is you, I don't know, like when 
# MAGIC I first ran on my computer, I was like, wow, this feels 
# MAGIC like democratization of AI's productivity. I'm just reading from 
# MAGIC the screen now. It's like, wow, I want to be productive. 
# MAGIC I want to make my own system. I can use the chat 
# MAGIC copilot to understand things like plugins, plans, and personas. 
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC Let me walk you through for a second, it's super important because what 
# MAGIC happens is if you wanted to build a what's called 
# MAGIC a chat gpt compatible plugin, you might ask yourself, "Wow I 
# MAGIC wrote that code how do i test it?" Well, that's what this 
# MAGIC chat compiler is there for. it lets you, basically click on the upper right 
# MAGIC corner, and add your chat gpt plugin you made 
# MAGIC in semantic kernel. all that work to make plugins it was 
# MAGIC worth it, and don't forget once you add all these plugins in 
# MAGIC there, what happens you end up being able to 
# MAGIC go, and you wait for it, And the plans will 
# MAGIC be auto generated in the context of your 
# MAGIC chat. And it sounds a little like wild, but it's pretty amazing. 
# MAGIC You can upload documents. 
# MAGIC Remember the similarity engine. You can try different 
# MAGIC versions of them out. You can try Azure Cognitive Search, 
# MAGIC Chroma, Quadrant, maybe you can also turn on plans. 
# MAGIC So, sort of see the plans AI generates. 
# MAGIC I know you're like, just too excited to go out, and 
# MAGIC use this right now, and no problem because again, it's open 
# MAGIC source and it's also iterating very quickly. So, it really is 
# MAGIC like this magical thing you've been waiting for. 
# MAGIC You didn't know existed and it's been made for you. You 
# MAGIC deserve it, don't you? 
# MAGIC And in the settings panel, you'll be able to see token usage in general. 
# MAGIC It really gives you a quick overview of how 
# MAGIC these systems work in production use cases. And 
# MAGIC on top of that, there is a backend server. This 
# MAGIC is the front end. The front end is pretty cool, right? So, 
# MAGIC the most powerful thing of our system is the backend server. It's basically 
# MAGIC Semantic Kernel as a service. You can 
# MAGIC flip on a bunch of things, like auth, more vector DBs. You can 
# MAGIC turn on telemetry. There's also content safety, meaning content filtering 
# MAGIC for more AI safety, responsible AI. There are ways 
# MAGIC to import different types of documents into your 
# MAGIC vector stores. And there's also OCR. We have some multimodal 
# MAGIC experiments running as well. 
# MAGIC So, you can also work with images in the system. Again, 
# MAGIC our focus has been large language models. But it's been kind of cool that 
# MAGIC we have different things that just come for free, basically, and 
# MAGIC they're there for you. So, if you look at the config file 
# MAGIC of the backend server, you'll see some of the goodness. You can set 
# MAGIC a default configuration for a different model for 
# MAGIC completion of editing a planner. You can actually 
# MAGIC have it talk if you want and also 
# MAGIC recognize speech. This is an engineer's dream authorization. You 
# MAGIC can use a Cosmos DB. You can, I mean, if you're 
# MAGIC like a nerd, like I can be on some days, you probably on all days, 
# MAGIC depending on who's listening in, who you are. Don't worry, I 
# MAGIC don't know who you are. But look at this. There are so many 
# MAGIC different things you can turn on. And, you know, 
# MAGIC one of my favorites, the application insights, the telemetry. Oh, so good, 
# MAGIC right? Thanks for listening into how business thinkers can 
# MAGIC start building a plug-in semantic kernel. Thank you 
# MAGIC for your time, and I hope your 
# MAGIC bucket of time gets plugged up, and your bucket of 
# MAGIC money starts to fill up too.
